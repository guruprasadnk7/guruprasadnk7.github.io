<em id="SDM2020Abs">Many real-world phenomena are observed at multiple resolutions. Predictive models designed to predict these phenomena typically consider different resolutions separately. This approach might be limiting in applications where predictions are desired at fine resolutions but available training data is scarce. In this paper, we propose classification algorithms that leverage supervision from coarser resolutions to help train models on finer resolutions. The different resolutions are modeled as different views of the data in a multi-view framework that exploits the complementarity of features across different views to improve models on both views. Unlike traditional multi-view learning problems, the key challenge in our case is that there is no one-to-one correspondence between instances across different views in our case, which requires explicit modeling of the correspondence of instances across resolutions. We propose to use the features of instances at different resolutions to learn the correspondence between instances across resolutions using an attention mechanism.Experiments on the real-world application of mapping urban areas using satellite observations and sentiment classification on text data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</em>

<em id="IRJAbs">Automated construction of knowledge hierarchies from huge data corpora is gaining increasing attention in recent years, in order to tackle the infeasibility of manually extracting and semantically linking millions of concepts. As a knowledge hierarchy evolves with these automated techniques, there is a need for measures to assess its temporal evolution, quantifying the similarities between diferent versions and identifying the relative growth of diferent subgraphs in the knowledge hierarchy. In this paper, we focus on measures that leverage structural properties of the knowledge hierarchy graph to assess the temporal changes. We propose a principled and scalable similarity measure, based on Katz similarity between concept nodes, for comparing diferent versions of a knowledge hierarchy, modeled as a generic directed acyclic graph. We present theoretical analysis to depict that the proposed measure accurately captures the salient properties of taxonomic hierarchies, assesses changes in the ordering of nodes, along with the logical subsumption of relationships among concepts. We also present a linear time variant of the measure, and show that our measures, unlike previous approaches, are tunable to cater to diverse application needs. We further show that our measure provides interpretability, thereby identifying the key structural and logical diference in the hierarchies. Experiments on a real DBpedia and biological knowledge hierarchy showcase that our measures accurately capture structural similarity, while providing enhanced scalability and tunability. Also, we demonstrate that the temporal evolution of diferent subgraphs in this knowledge hierarchy, as captured purely by our structural measure, corresponds well with the known disruptions in the related subject areas.</em>

<em id="SDM19_1Abs">Recent advances in processing remote sensing data have provided unprecedented potential for monitoring land covers. However, it is extremely challenging to deploy an automated monitoring system for different regions and across different years given the involved data heterogeneity over space and over time. The heterogeneity exists on two aspects. First, for many land covers, the distinguishing temporal patterns are only visible in certain discriminative period. Due to the change of weather conditions, the discriminative period can shift across space and time, which causes heterogeneity to the sequential data. Second, the collected remote sensing data are affected by acquisition devices and natural variables, e.g., precipitation and sunlight. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to effectively detect land covers using the sequential remote sensing data. At the same time, we propose new learning strategies based on attention networks and domain adaptation to addresses the aforementioned challenges. The evaluation on two real-world applications - cropland mapping and burned area detection, demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect land covers under different weather conditions.

<em id="SDM19_2Abs">Detecting land use and land cover changes is critical to monitor natural resources and analyze global environmental changes. In this paper, we investigate the land cover detection using the remote sensing data from earth-observing satellites. Due to the natural disturbances, e.g., clouds and aerosoles, and the data acquisition errors by devices, remote sensing data frequently contain much noise. Also, many land covers cannot be easily identified in most dates of a year. Instead, they show distinctive temporal patterns only during certain period of a year, which is also referred to as the discriminative period. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework which combines the spatial context knowledge with the LSTM-based temporal modeling for land cover detection. Specifically, the framework learns the spatial context knowledge selectively from its neighboring locations. Then we propose two approaches for discriminative period detection based on multi-instance learning and local attention mechanism, respectively. Our evaluations in two real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying land covers and detecting discriminative periods.

In this paper, we propose to learn discriminative patterns from the entire length of the time series, and use them as predictive features to identify the class of interest. We propose a novel neural network algorithm to learn the key signature of the class of interest as a function of the feature values together with the discriminative pattern made from that signature through the entire time series in a joint framework.

<em id="RS18Abs">This paper presents an application of a novel machine-learning framework on MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data to map burned areas over tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia. The RAPT (RAre Class Prediction in the absence of True labels) framework is able to build data adaptive classification models using noisy training labels. It is particularly suitable when expert annotated training samples are difficult to obtain as in the case of wild fires in the tropics. This framework has been used to build burned area maps from MODIS surface reflectance data as features and Active Fire hotspots as training labels that are known to have high commission and omission errors due to the prevalence of cloud cover and smoke, especially in the tropics. Using the RAPT framework we report burned areas for 16 MODIS tiles from 2001 to 2014. The total burned area detected in the tropical forests of South America and South-east Asia during these years is 2,071,378 MODIS (500 m) pixels (approximately 520 K sq. km.), which is almost three times compared to the estimates from collection 5 MODIS MCD64A1 (783,468 MODIS pixels). An evaluation using Landsat-based reference burned area maps indicates that our product has an average user’s accuracy of 53% and producer’s accuracy of 55% while collection 5 MCD64A1 burned area product has an average user’s accuracy of 61% and producer’s accuracy of 27%. Our analysis also indicates that the two products can be complimentary and a combination of the two approaches is likely to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tropical fires. Finally, we have created a publicly accessible web-based viewer that helps the community to visualize the burned area maps produced using RAPT and examine various validation sources corresponding to every detected MODIS pixel.

<em id="TKDE17Abs">Many real-world problems involve learning models for rare classes in situations where there are no gold standard labels for training samples but imperfect labels are available for all instances. In this paper, we present RAPT, a three step predictive modeling framework for classifying rare class in such problem settings. The first step of the proposed framework learns a classifier that jointly optimizes precision and recall by only using imperfectly labeled training samples. We also show that, under certain assumptions on the imperfect labels, the quality of this classifier is almost as good as the one constructed using perfect labels. The second and third steps of the framework make use of the fact that imperfect labels are available for all instances to further improve the precision and recall of the rare class. We evaluate the RAPT frameworkon two real-world applications of mapping forest fires and urban extent from earth observing satellite data. The experimental results indicate that RAPTcan be used to identifyforest fires and urban areas with high precision and recall by using imperfect labels, even though obtaining expert annotated samples on a global scale is infeasible in these applications.

<em id="KDD17Abs">Land cover prediction is essential for monitoring global environmental change. Unfortunately, traditional classification models are plagued by temporal variation and emergence of novel/unseen land cover classes in the prediction process. In this paper, we propose an LSTM-based spatio-temporal learning framework with a dual-memory structure. The dual-memory structure captures both long-term and short-term temporal variation patterns, and is updated incrementally to adapt the model to the ever-changing environment. Moreover, we integrate zero-shot learning to identify unseen classes even without labelled samples. Experiments on both synthetic zand real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over multiple baselines in land cover prediction.</em>

<em id="SDM17Abs">Successful land cover prediction can provide promising insights in the applications where manual labeling is extremely difficult. However, traditional machine learning models are plagued by temporal variation and noisy features when directly applied to land cover prediction. Moreover, these models cannot take fully advantage of the spatio-temporal relationship involved in land cover transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal framework to discover the transitions among land covers and at the same time conduct classification at each time step. Based on the proposed model, we incrementally update the model parameters in the prediction process, thus to mitigate the impact of the temporal variation. Our experiments in two challenging land cover applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over multiple baselines. In addition, we show the efficacy of spatio-temporal transition modeling and incremental learning through extensive analysis.</em>

<em id="CI16Abs">Mapping burned area on a global scale typically requires the use of a weak signal like Active Fire for training the burned scar classification model. Since these weak signals typically are inaccurate with respect to temporal and spatial pinpointing of the event occurrence, the use of Multiple instance learning paradigm to model the occurrence of the event in a wider spatio-temporal window is demonstrably beneficial than using the exact date of the weak signal. In this work, we demonstrate the use of MIL algorithm to model the temporal uncertainty of the weak signal. We further propose an noise-robust extension to the MIL paradigm for learning on sequence data.
